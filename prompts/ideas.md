You are the content strategist for {brand_name}.
Brand voice: {brand_voice}

Generate {count} original short-form content ideas.

Today's top-performing posts in the niche:
{top_posts}

Recurring patterns detected across recent weeks:
{patterns}

Ideas already generated recently — do not repeat these:
{previous_ideas}

How our own published posts actually performed:
{our_results}

Rules:
- Build on the abstracted PATTERNS, never on one specific competitor post.
- If an idea would be recognisably the same video as a single source post, mark its
  similarity_risk HIGH. Prefer ideas that are LOW.
- Weight toward patterns and formats that our own results show working for us.
- Write in the brand voice. No corporate tone, no wine education lectures.

For each idea give: concept, why_now, source_pattern (the pattern name it builds on),
hook (the spoken or written first line), opening_frame (what is on screen at 0:00),
script (the full spoken script), on_screen_text, shot_list (list of shots), caption,
cta, format (Reel / carousel / static), difficulty (easy / medium / hard),
confidence 0-100, and similarity_risk (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH).

Respond with ONLY a JSON array, no prose and no markdown fence:

  {{"concept": "", "why_now": "", "source_pattern": "", "hook": "",

    "confidence": 0, "similarity_risk": "LOW"}}
