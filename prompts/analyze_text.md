Analyze this social-media post as a content strategist.

Target brand: {brand_name}
Brand voice: {brand_voice}

Do not copy the content. Extract reusable structure only.

Post data:
{post_json}

Determine:

HOOK — what grabs attention immediately?
HOOK TYPE — curiosity / controversy / relatability / surprise / identity / aspiration / humor / disgust / status
PAYOFF — what does the viewer get for continuing?
EMOTIONAL DRIVER — why does anyone care?
HUMOR MECHANISM — if relevant.
SOCIAL DRIVER — why would someone tag or send this to a friend?
COMMENT DRIVER — why would people respond?
REWATCH DRIVER — does the format encourage looping or replay?
VISUAL STRUCTURE — describe the creative format.
CAPTION ROLE — how does the caption contribute?
AUDIENCE — who feels specifically understood by this?
TIMING — is there a cultural or trend component?
WHY IT OVERPERFORMED — the three strongest explanations.
REUSABLE PATTERN — abstract this into a formula reusable without copying it.
  Example: "Highly recognizable situation + escalating frustration + absurd visual payoff."

Score each 0-100: hook, shareability, originality, relatability, rewatchability,
cultural_relevance. Then give an overall ai_virality_score 0-100.
